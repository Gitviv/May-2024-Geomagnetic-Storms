            <h2>The Beauty of Auroras</h2>
            <p>Auroras, often referred to as the Northern and Southern Lights (Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis), are natural light displays predominantly seen in polar regions. They occur when charged particles from the Sun, known as the solar wind, collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere. As these particles enter the atmosphere near the poles, they interact with oxygen and nitrogen molecules at altitudes of 80 to 300 kilometers. These collisions excite the gas molecules, causing them to release energy in the form of light. The colors of the auroras vary: oxygen can produce green and red hues, while nitrogen can create blue or purple shades. The result is a breathtaking spectacle of swirling lights that dance across the night sky, typically seen in areas near the magnetic poles.</p>

            <h2>How Auroras Form</h2>
            <p>Auroras form when charged particles from the Sun, carried by the solar wind, collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere. As these particles enter the atmosphere near the polar regions, they interact with gases like oxygen and nitrogen at altitudes of 80 to 300 kilometers. These collisions excite the gas molecules, causing them to release energy in the form of light. The color of the auroras varies depending on the type of gas involved, with oxygen producing green and red hues and nitrogen creating blue or purple shades. This stunning light display, known as the Northern or Southern Lights, occurs primarily near the magnetic poles.</p>

                <h2>Visibility During Storms</h2>
                <p>Auroras can become more visible during solar storms, which are significant disturbances in Earth's magnetosphere caused by increased solar activity. When the Sun emits a large burst of solar wind or coronal mass ejection (CME), it can enhance the flow of charged particles toward Earth. During these storms, the intensity of the auroras increases, and they can appear further from the poles than usual. This means that areas not typically associated with aurora visibility, such as northern U.S. states or even regions farther south, may experience vibrant auroral displays. The increased solar activity can lead to more vivid colors and more dynamic shapes in the auroras, making them a spectacular sight for those lucky enough to witness them during such events.</p>

                <h2>Colors and Shapes</h2>
                <p>Auroras display a stunning array of colors and shapes, primarily influenced by the type of gas involved in the atmospheric collisions and their altitude. The most common color is green, produced by oxygen molecules at altitudes of 100 to 250 kilometers (about 60 to 155 miles). Red hues, also from oxygen but at higher altitudes, appear less frequently and often at the tops of auroras. Purple and blue colors, resulting from nitrogen emissions, contribute to the palette as well. In terms of shapes, auroras often resemble flowing curtains or long arcs that stretch across the sky, with some exhibiting sharp ray-like structures or swirling patterns. This dynamic interplay of colors and shapes creates a mesmerizing spectacle that captivates observers in polar and subpolar regions.</p>
